# Basic-Cybersecurity-Project
This is a simple cyber security project using asymmetric key encryption technique and SHA-256 hashing, implemented through python language.

This project shows how security features are added in the usual flow of the organisations, by simulating an organisation where employees are communicating among themselves by sharing confidential and sensitive imformation. 

To authenticate users, there is a basic password and userId based login criteria. In order to ensure that only the intended users are able to view the respective messegaes, asymmetric key encryption will be used. Also, to ensure the integrity of the data in the underlying database, SHA-256 hash comparison technique has been implemented.


Language specific details:- 

Category of application - python flask application

Library used for encryption/decryption and hash mechanism - cryptography

Library used for database (Oracle 11g) connection - cx_Oracle
